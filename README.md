# Restaurant Review Application

## Project Overview

Testing my knowledge of service workers and local caching. This project is from **Udacity front end nano degree course**. 

## Getting Started

**Please Note that this project requires a live server! Try using the vsc live server extension.**

1. Download the Repo using 
> git clone https://github.com/keeganH222/Restaurant-Reviews.git

2. Open the code using terminal command code .

3. Edit dbhelper.js and change the function get restaurants with the port of your serve and change the return to  ```return "localhost:#${port}"```

4. Go ahead and click on the vsc extension Go Live to see the results.

If you not using vsc Live server and trying through a different Server method the caching may not work since it has not been optimatized.
